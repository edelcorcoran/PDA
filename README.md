**What's in My Repository**
- gitignore file
- licence
- numpy.random.ipynb file
- README.md file
- images for project 



**Software you need**
- Start by downloading the latest version of Anaconda onto your computer. The default version of the software comes with Jupyter notebook installed so you won't need to install this separately. 
- You can clone my repository to you machine by clicking on "the clone/copy link" icon on Github.
- On the command line choose where you want to clone for example maybe on your Desktop, so type "cd .." to exit your current location and type "cd Desktop", you'll proabably choose a folder on your desktop if so cd into it, then type "git clone (paste link here)" and hit "enter". The repository should now be visible on your desktop.
- 0n the command line ensure your in the correct folder
- Type "jupyter notebook" on the command line and a new browser tab will open displaying a list of files (ie. repository contents).
- If you click into the "numpy.random.ipynb", this file contains the bulk of the assignment.
- If you want to run or re-run any code in the .ipynb file just click into the relevant cell and hold down "Shift" and "Enter" together.


**Libraries Utilised in python code**
- numpy as np
- matplotlib as plt
